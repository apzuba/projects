#Project: Modelling semantic, machine-learning-based text analysis. Supervisor: prof. dr. hab. in≈º. Grzegorz Nalepa.

Regonising the semantic valence of a text is a complex function. The goal of the project was to train and choose the best Machine Learning model for recognising the emotional valence of a text, adjusting the multi-factor influences. The models were trained and used in both the English and Polish languages. 

0. Selected filters, machine learning techniques, and text complexity.

The project implemented:
1. Data pre-processing
2. Data tokenisation
3. Implementing Naive Bayes interpreter 
4. Preparing the Embeddeding Layer
5. Implementing Simple Neural Network
6. Implementing Convolutional Neural Network
7. Implementing Recurrent Neural Network

8. Analyzed and compared the effectiveness of models with reconigising the advantages and disadvantages of each model, as well as leading factors that influence the model score.
