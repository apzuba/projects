Welcome! This directory contains some of the programming projects that I worked on until this point.

@The technologies found here include: Python, SQL, HTML & CSS, JavaScript and .R.

@Python Frameworks: Flask, Keras, PsychoPy, as well as multiple Python Packages found within.


- Python folder contains the folders LPTHW (tasks from the Learn Python The Hard Way textbook), PsychoPy, algorithmic scripts, a Machine Learning Keras project, and a showcase for a Python-game hosted via Flask, integrated with SQL. The showcase project demonstrates a working user database management system (Login, Registrateion, User deleting, Edit, Admin Panel, Feedback popups and more). 

- example_sql_commands.sql file includes the example SQL commands that I learned and used during the SQL courses I took. The courses include:
   - A) Simplilearn (9h, Beginner Level): Introduction to SQL 
   - B) Coursera (16h, Intermediate Level): Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL) by 
        prof. Charles Russell Severance, University of Michigan 

- The .R folder includes .R scripts that I developed with supervision of dr. Renate Rutiku for usage in my MSc Project. The scripts operate on complex multi-level statistics.

- HTML folder includes two example websites: 1) a Health Clinique that uses simple JavaScript scripts for features such as drag-drop menus, or forms; 2) A books-lending project with slightly more extended CSS usage.
