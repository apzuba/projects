#Project: Modelling semantic, machine-learning-based text analysis. 

@authors: Adam Zuba, Paweł Ciślik, Agnija Bogdaniuk, Supervision: prof. dr. hab. inż. Grzegorz Nalepa

Regonising the semantic valence of a text is a complex function. The goal of the project was to train and choose the best Machine Learning model for recognising the emotional valence of a text, adjusting the multi-factor influences. The models were trained and used in both the English and Polish languages. The database for the Polish langauge was scrapped with a script from a populer film reviews website (filmweb.pl).

0. Selected filters, machine learning techniques, and text complexity.

The project implemented:
1. Data pre-processing
2. Data tokenisation
3. Implementing Naive Bayes interpreter 
4. Preparing the Embeddeding Layer
5. Implementing Simple Neural Network
6. Implementing Convolutional Neural Network
7. Implementing Recurrent Neural Network

8. Analyzed and compared the effectiveness of models with reconigising the advantages and disadvantages of each model, as well as leading factors that influence the model score.

The project was developed in Jupyter Notebook IDE, using Keras ML framework, following an online Machine-Learning Tutorial and under a supervisor of prof. dr. hab. inż. Grzegorz Nalepa. The project was a course project for the class of Workshops in Cognitive Engineering at Jagiellonian University. The project group involved three students.

I attatch the saved Jupyter output files from the stages of 1) Preprocessing + implementing Naive Bayes 2) implementation of the three ML models.
