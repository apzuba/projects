- ex47 - an example of basic setup of a game project in a seperate environment, with a simple unit test.

  This game is a result of three weeks of work in my initial phase of learning. 
  Some of the developed functions: multi-choice combat system, end-of-mission raporting system, 
  compliments generator, HP and inventory module, gold and a multi-path scenario. Warning, the game isn't easy! :)
